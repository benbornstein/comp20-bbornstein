# Benjamin Bornstein - COMP20 Assignment 4: Security and Privacy Assessment of Private Car Service (Assignments 2 and 3)

## Description
I successfully analyzed my partner's work and found/reported four (4) issues found with his Private Car Service code. In order to do this, I utilized curl within my terminal, my partner's heroku application, my partner's Assignment 3 code (index.js specifically), and my partner's mongolab database. I created a security folder and index.html file, both of which were pushed to github, as these were the two requested deliverables. My document contains all of the required sections: Introduction, Methodology, Abstract of Findings, Issues Found, Conclusion, and References. I also created a stylesheet (style.css) for my index.html file and included image proof of the issues I discovered. Lastly, I ensured that my report was grammatically correct.

## Collaboration/Discussion
I collaborated on this assignment with Vichka Fonarev, who was assigned as my partner.

## Duration
I spent approximately 6 hours completing this assignment.
