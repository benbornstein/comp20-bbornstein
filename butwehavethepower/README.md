# Benjamin Bornstein - COMP20 Lab 5

## Description
I successfully implemented lyric annotations for the Union Strike Folk Song, through writing javascript in the designated area of the given HTML code, within an index.html file. Furthermore, I added styling in a separate style.css file and, because my styling involves a GIF background, I also included the GIF, "heronamedhomer.gif" within the "butwehavethepower" folder which also contains index.html, style.css, and this README.md file.

## Collaboration/Discussion
This was a solo assignment; I did not collaborate/discuss it with any peers.

## Duration
I spent approximately 5 hours completing this lab.
